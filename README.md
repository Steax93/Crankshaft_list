# Crankshaft_list
Here I present to you my second project "Cranskshaft_list" where I worked with advertisements for vehicles data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle. 
From all the work that I have done, working with missing values, cleaning the data, finding main parameters, and working with outliers. 
I came to a few conclusions on which parameters depend on the prices of the cars
